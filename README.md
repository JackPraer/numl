**NUDE Elements** is a mix of four concepts: 

* **Language** - Alternative markup language for the modern web that meant to be a partial HTML/CSS replacement to describe complex responsive interfaces and dynamic relations between elements without frustration but with fun and highest compatibility with other modern technologies.
* **Methodology** - Simple and intuitive methodology to ensure your apps look and work great. It eliminates some confusing conceptions as "margins" and brings clarity and order to your markup.
* **Framework** - Powerful next-generation JS-Powered CSS-Framework based on Custom Elements that solves many fundamental problems like element inheritance, efficient runtime CSS-generation, theme color generation, sane id linking and affordable accessibility.
* **Library** - Highly-customizable built-in components to ensure you have everything to start creating handy components and wonderful accessible interfaces with responsiveness.

**UNDER RAPID DEVELOPMENT, API is subject to change**

```

And that's all! Now your application is **NUDE-ready**!

Try to write some HTML to build awesome interfaces.

```html
<nu-card
  display="flex"
  width="clamp(320px, 100%, initial)"
  responsive="480px"
  labelledby="heading"
  describedby="description price"
  gap="1" flow="row|column" items="start|initial">
  <nu-icon name="package" size="4" place="start"></nu-icon>
  <nu-flow gap=".5" grow="1">
    <nu-heading level="3" id="heading">Product name</nu-heading>
    <nu-line></nu-line>
    <nu-block id="description">Very very long product description</nu-block>
    <nu-flex gap="1" items="center|start" flow="row|column-reverse">

## Build

`npm run build` builds the library to `dist`, generating four files:

* `dist/numl.js` - IIFE-module with auto initialization. Elements' CSS included. (Exports global `Nude` object)
* `dist/numl.dev.js` - Same as above but with helpful warnings and without minification. (Exports global `Nude` object)
* `dist/numl.module.js` - ES-module. Tree-shaking-friendly bundle. Elements' CSS included.
* `dist/numl.module.dev.js` - Same as above but with helpful warnings and without minification.

`npm run dev` builds the library, then keeps rebuilding it whenever the source files change.

## Local playground

Run `npm run play` to view test page with few examples.
