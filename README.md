## Development status (v1)

Current status of development is [HERE](https://github.com/tenphi/nude/projects/1).

Here is our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/zEGV1W3L/nude-framework).

### Browser Support

Based on [caniuse.com](caniuse.com). Real-world support table will be presented after production-release.

* Microsoft Edge 15-18 (with [@webcomponents/custom-elements polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/custom-elements), 5kb)
* Microsoft Edge 76+
* Google Chrome 57+
* Mozilla Firefox 52+
* Apple Safari 10.1+
* Apple iOS Safari 10.3+
* Google Android 67+

## Getting started

`npm run build` builds the library to `dist`, generating five files:

* `dist/nude.js` - ES-module. Tree-shaking-friendly bundle. Elements' CSS included.
* `dist/nude.dev.js` - Same as above but without minification and with helpful warnings.
* `dist/nude.pack.js` - Classic JS-Bundle with all elements. Elements' CSS included. (Exposes global `Nude` object)
* `dist/nude.pack.dev.js` - Same as above but without minification and with helpful warnings. (Exposes global `Nude` object)

`npm run dev` builds the library, then keeps rebuilding it whenever the source files change.

## Usage
Add `nude.js` to your page and initialize it.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/nude-elements/dist/nude.pack.css" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/nude-elements/dist/nude.pack.js">
  Nude.init();
</script>
```

Add `data-nu-root` attribute to the root element. Preferably, to the `body` tag.

```html
<body data-nu-root></body>
```

That's all. Now your application is **NUDE-ready**! Try to write some HTML to build awesome interfaces.

```html
<nu-flex flow="column" gap=".5">
  <nu-block>
    Example text. <nu-link>Example link</nu-link>. <nu-badge>Example badge</nu-badge>.
  </nu-block>
</nu-flex>
```

Nude Elements are also available via npm.
```bash
$ npm install nude-elements
```

Import the module to your application:
```javascript
import Nude from 'nude-elements';

Nude.init();
```
