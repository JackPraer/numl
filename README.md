# NUDE - Nano UI Design Elements

Smallest UI library based on Custom Elements and CSS Grid.

IN DEVELOPMENT

## Getting started

`npm run build` builds the library to `dist`, generating three files:

* `dist/nude.js`
* `dist/nude.modifiers.css`
* `dist/nude.global.css`
* `dist/nude.pack.js`
* `dist/nude.pack.css`
        
`npm run dev` builds the library, then keeps rebuilding it whenever the source files change.
