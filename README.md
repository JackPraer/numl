**NUDE Elements** is a mix of four concepts: 

* **Language** - Alternative markup language for the modern web that meant to be a partial HTML/CSS replacement to describe complex responsive interfaces and dynamic relations between elements without frustration but with fun and highest compatibility with other modern technologies.
* **Methodology** - Simple and intuitive methodology to ensure your apps look and work great. It eliminates some confusing conceptions as "margins" and brings clarity and order to your markup.
* **Framework** - Powerful next-generation JS-Powered CSS-Framework based on Custom Elements that solves many fundamental problems like element inheritance, efficient runtime CSS-generation, theme color generation, sane id linking and affordable accessibility.
* **Library** - Highly-customizable built-in components to ensure you have everything to start creating handy components and wonderful accessible interfaces with responsiveness.

**UNDER RAPID DEVELOPMENT, API is subject to change**

## Getting started

`npm run build` builds the library to `dist`, generating four files:

* `dist/numl.js` - IIFE-module with auto initialization. Elements' CSS included. (Exports global `Nude` object)
* `dist/numl.dev.js` - Same as above but with helpful warnings and without minification. (Exports global `Nude` object)
* `dist/numl.module.js` - ES-module. Tree-shaking-friendly bundle. Elements' CSS included.
* `dist/numl.module.dev.js` - Same as above but with helpful warnings and without minification.

`npm run dev` builds the library, then keeps rebuilding it whenever the source files change.

## Usage
Add `numl.js` to your page and initialize it.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/numl/dist/numl.js"></script>
```

And that's all! Now your application is **NUDE-ready**!

Try to write some HTML to build awesome interfaces.

```html
<nu-card responsive="420px" width="clamp(320px, 100%, initial)">
  <nu-flex gap="1" items="start" flow="row|column">
    <nu-icon name="package" size="4"></nu-icon>
    <nu-flow gap=".5" grow="1">
      <nu-heading level="3">Product name</nu-heading>
      <nu-block>Very very long product description</nu-block>
      <nu-flex gap="1" items="center|start" flow="row|column-reverse">
        <nu-btn special>
          <nu-icon name="dollar-sign" inline></nu-icon>
          Order now
        </nu-btn>
        <nu-badge mod="lg|md">Only $99.99</nu-badge>
      </nu-flex>
    </nu-flow>
  </nu-flex>
</nu-card>
```

Nude Elements are also available via npm.
```bash
$ npm install numl --save
```

Import the module to your application:
```javascript
