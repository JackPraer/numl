# Widgets

Widgets are a little different from simple NUDE elements. They have their own logic and life-cycle hooks. But their usage is very simple.

## nu-btn

Simple button that can be clicked. It generates `tap` event when it's clicked or tapped. You can make it pressed if specify that attribute.

```html
<!-- simple button -->
<nu-btn>Button text</nu-btn>
<!-- pressed button -->
<nu-btn pressed>Button text</nu-btn>
```
